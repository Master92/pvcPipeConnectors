# PVC pipe connectors

This repository holds the OpenSCAD files for PVC pipe connectors used for building RaceGOW gates with 20mm conduit.

## Generating STL files

This repo holds a CMake file that can be used to generate one or more connectors in batch.
The objects can be generated by running the following commands:

**Linux:**
```Shell
cmake -B <build_dir> .
cmake --build <build_dir>
```

**Windows:**
```Batchfile
cmake -B <build_dir> . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD"
cmake --build <build_dir>
```

The generated files can then be found in the `<build_dir>` directory.

### Generating ABS connectors

The ABS option can be used to generate connectors for printing in ABS material. This special option will increase the
size of the upward facing part of the connector by 2% to account for shrinking. If you find that factor doesn't work
with your printer, you can adjust it in the CMakeLists.txt file.
